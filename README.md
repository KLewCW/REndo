# The REndo Package

Endogeneity arises when the independence assumption between an
explanatory variable and the error in a statistical model is violated.
Among its most common causes are omitted variable bias (e.g. like
ability in the returns to education estimation), measurement error
(e.g. survey response bias), or simultaneity (e.g. advertising and
sales).

Instrumental variable estimation is a common treatment when endogeneity
is of concern. However valid, strong external instruments are difficult
to find. Consequently, statistical methods to correct for endogeneity
without external instruments have been advanced. They are called
**internal instrumental variable models (IIV)**.

REndo implements the following instrument-free methods:

1)  latent instrumental variables approach (Ebbes, Wedel, Boeckenholt,
    and Steerneman 2005)

2)  higher moments estimation (Lewbel 1997)

3)  heteroskedastic error approach (Lewbel 2012)

4)  joint estimation using copula (Park and Gupta 2012)

5)  copula instrumental model (Haschka 2025)

6)  two-stage copula endogeneity correction (Yang et al. 2025)

7)  Adjusted Gaussian Copula Estimator (Liengaard et al. 2025)

8)  Nonparametric control function with asymptotic theory (Breitung et
    al. 2024)

9)  two-stage nonparametric copula endogeneity correction (Hu et
    al. 2025)

10) multilevel GMM (Kim and Frees 2007)

## The new version - REndo 2.5.0

The new version of **REndo** comes with a lot of improvements in terms
of code optimization as well as different syntax for all functions.

## Walk-Through

Below, we present the syntax for each of the 10 implemented
instrument-free methods:

### **Latent Instrumental Variables**

    latentIV(y ~ P, data, start.params=c()) 

The first argument is the formula of the model to be estimated, **y ~
P**, where **y** is the response and **P** is the endogenous regressor.
The second argument is the name of the dataset used and the last one,
**start.params=c()**, which is optional, is a vector with the initial
parameter values. When not indicated, the initial parameter values are
taken to be the coefficients returned by the OLS estimator of **y** on
**P**.

### **Higher Moments**

    higherMomentsIV(y ~ X1 + X2 + P | P | IIV(iiv = gp, g= x2, X1, X2) + IIV(iiv = yp) | Z1, data)

Here, **y** is the response; the first RHS of the formula, **X1 + X2 +
P**, is the model to be estimated; the second part, **P**, specifies the
endogenous regressors; the third part, **IIV()**, specifies the format
of the internal instruments; the fourth part, **Z1**, is optional,
allowing the user to add any external instruments available.

Regarding the third part of the formula, **IIV()**, it has a set of
three arguments:

- **iiv** - specifies the form of the instrument,
- **g** - specifies the transformation to be done on the exogenous
  regressors,
- the set of exogenous variables from which the internal instruments
  should be built (it can be one or all of the exogenous variables).

A set of six instruments can be constructed, which should be specified
in the **iiv** argument of **IIV()**:

- **g** - for
  ![(G\_{t} - \bar{G})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28G_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BG%7D%29 "(G_{t} - \bar{G})"),
- **gp** - for
  ![(G\_{t} - \bar{G})(P\_{t}-\bar{P})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28G_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BG%7D%29%28P_%7Bt%7D-%5Cbar%7BP%7D%29 "(G_{t} - \bar{G})(P_{t}-\bar{P})"),
- **gy** - for
  ![(G\_{t} - \bar{G})(Y\_{t}-\bar{Y})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28G_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BG%7D%29%28Y_%7Bt%7D-%5Cbar%7BY%7D%29 "(G_{t} - \bar{G})(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})"),
- **yp** - for
  ![(Y\_{t} - \bar{Y})(P\_{t}-\bar{P})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28Y_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BY%7D%29%28P_%7Bt%7D-%5Cbar%7BP%7D%29 "(Y_{t} - \bar{Y})(P_{t}-\bar{P})"),
- **p2** - for
  ![(P\_{t} - \bar{P})^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28P_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BP%7D%29%5E2 "(P_{t} - \bar{P})^2"),
- **y2** - for
  ![(Y\_{t} - \bar{Y})^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28Y_%7Bt%7D%20-%20%5Cbar%7BY%7D%29%5E2 "(Y_{t} - \bar{Y})^2").

where
![G=G(X\_{t})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%3DG%28X_%7Bt%7D%29 "G=G(X_{t})")
can be either ![x^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E2 "x^2"),
![x^3](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5E3 "x^3"),
![ln(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ln%28x%29 "ln(x)") or
![\frac{1}{x}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D "\frac{1}{x}")
and should be specified in the **g** argument of the third RHS of the
formula, as **x2, x3, lnx** or **1/x**. In case of internal instruments
built only from the endogenous regressor, e.g. **p2**, or from the
response and the endogenous regressor, like for example in **yp**, there
is no need to specify **g** or the set of exogenous regressors in the
**IIV()** part of the formula. The function returns a set of tests for
checking the validity of the instruments and the endogeneity assumption.

### **Heteroskedastic Errors**

     hetErrorsIV(y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + P | P | IIV(X1,X2) | Z1, data)

Here, **y** is the response variable, **X1 + X2 + X3 + P** represents
the model to be estimated; the second part, **P**, specifies the
endogenous regressors, the third part, **IIV(X1, X2)**, specifies the
exogenous heteroskedastic variables from which the instruments are
derived, while the final part **Z1** is optional, allowing the user to
include additional external instrumental variables. Like in the higher
moments approach, allowing the inclusion of additional external
variables is a convenient feature of the function, since it increases
the efficiency of the estimates. Transformation of the explanatory
variables, such as I(X), ln(X) are possible both in the model
specification as well as in the IIV() specification.

### **Copula Correction**

    copulaCorrection( y ~ X1 + X2 + P1 + P2 | continuous(P1) + discrete(P2), data, start.params=c(), num.boots)

The first argument is a two-part formula of the model to be estimated,
with the second part of the RHS defining the endogenous regressor, here
**continuous(P1) + discrete(P2)**. The second argument is the name of
the data, the third argument of the function, **start.params**, is
optional and represents the initial parameter values supplied by the
user (when missing, the OLS estimates are considered); while the fourth
argument, **num.boots**, also optional, is the number of bootstraps to
be performed (the default is 1000). Of course, defining the endogenous
regressors depends on the number of endogenous regressors and their
assumed distribution. Transformations of the explanatory variables, such
as I(X), ln(X) are supported.

### **Copula Instrumental Model Approach**

    copulaIMA(y ~ X + P - 1 | continuous(P), data, num.boots, cdf)

Here, **y** is the response variable, **X + P** represents the model to
be estimated. The **-1** in the formula suppresses the intercept as
required by the method. The second part identifies the endogenous
regressors via **continuous()**. The second argument is the name of the
dataset. The optional argument **num.boots** sets the number of
bootstrap replications used to compute standard errors. The default is
1000. The argument **cdf** specifies the estimator used to transform
regressors to normal scores (default is **“adj.ecdf”**; alternatives are
**“ecdf”**, **“resc.ecdf”**, and **“kde”**).

### **Two-Stage Copula Endogeneity Correction**

    copula2sCOPE(y ~ X + P | continuous(P), data, num.boots, cdf)

Here **y** is the response variable, **X + P** represents the model to
be estimated; the second part identifies the endogenous regressors via
**continuous()**. The second argument is the name of the dataset.
**num.boots** sets the number of bootstrap replications used to compute
standard errors (default 1000). The argument **cdf** specifies the
estimator used to transform regressors to normal scores (options are
**“ecdf”**, **“adj.ecdf”**, **“resc.ecdf”**, and **“kde”**) and is
applied to all regressors. For each endogenous normal score, a
regression on the exogenous normal scores is estimated with an
intercept, and the residuals is the correction terms in an augmented
OLS. When no exogenous regressors are present the method reduces to Park
and Gupta (2012). This method can be used for multiple endogenous
regressors.

### **Adjusted Gaussian Copula Estimator**

    copulaJAMS(y ~ W + Z + P + P:W | continuous(P), data, cdf = "adj.ecdf", num.boots)

Here **y** is the response variable, the first part of the formula
represents the structural model and may include interaction terms and
transformations. The second part identifies the continuous endogenous
regressors via **continuous()**. The argument **cdf** specifies the CDF
estimator (options are **“adj.ecdf”**, **“resc.ecdf”**, **“ecdf”**, and
**“kde”**, default **“adj.ecdf”** is recommended). The JAMS method
handles **discrete exogenous regressors Z** by stratifying the data by
**Z** level and estimating copula correction terms separately within
each group. This allows the endogeneity structure to vary across groups
of the discrete variable. Discrete exogenous regressors must be stored
as ‘factor’ in the data to activate the stratification.

### **Two-Stage Nonparametric Copula Endogeneity Correction**

    copula2sCOPEnp(y ~ X + P | P, data, num.boots, npcdistbw.args)

Here **y** is the response variable, **X + P** represents the model to
be estimated; the second part lists the endogenous regressors . The
second argument is the name of the dataset. **num.boots** sets the
number of bootstrap replications used to compute standard errors
(default 1000). The optional argument **npcdistbw.args** is a named list
of arguments passed to the kernel bandwidth selector **npcdistbw** from
the **np** package, allowing the user to control bandwidth selection.
The method estimates the conditional CDF of each endogenous regressor
given the exogenous regressors nonparametrically, using the
Nadaraya-Warson kernel regression. This relaxes the Gaussian copula
assumption. The method supports both continuous and discrete endogenous
regressors. Bandwidths are computed once on the original data and reused
across all bootstrap resamples. Multiple endogenous and exogenous
regressors are also supported.

### **Nonparametric Control Function (BMW method)**

    copulaBMW(y ~ X + P | continuous(P), data, cdf = "resc.ecdf", num.boots)

Here **y** is the response variable, **X+P** represents the model to be
estimated; the second part identifies the endogenous regressors via
**continuous()**. The second argument is the name of the dataset.
**num.boots** sets the number of bootstrap replications used to compute
standard errors (default 1000). The argument **cdf** specifies the
estimator used to transform regressors to normal scores (options are
**“ecdf”**, **“adj.ecdf”**, **“resc.ecdf”**, and **“kde”**) and is
applied to all regressors. The method regresses each endogenous
regressor ![P_k](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_k "P_k") on the
exogenous regressors ![X](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X "X")
directly in the **original space**, then applies the CDF to the
first-stage residuals. The method does not require a Gaussian copula
assumption on the distribution of the structural error and the
endogenous regressor error. The method only assumes
![f(e) \sim N(0,1)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%28e%29%20%5Csim%20N%280%2C1%29 "f(e) \sim N(0,1)").
It also allows conditional heteroskedasticity of the structural error.
The BMW estimator is a copula-based method in REndo with formal
asymptotic theory. BMW comes with mathematical proofs that the estimates
are consistent (converge to true values as
![n \to \infty](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty "n \to \infty")),
asymptotically normally distributed, and that bootstrap standard errors
are valid.

### **Multilevel GMM**

    multilevelIV(y ~ X11 + X12 + X21 + X22 + X23 + X31 + X33 + X34 + (1|CID) + (1|SID) | endo(X12), data)  

The call of the function has a two-part formula and an argument for data
specification. In the formula, the first part is the model
specification, with fixed and random parameter specification, and the
second part which specifies the regressors assumed endogenous, here
**endo(X12)**. The function returns the parameter estimates obtained
with fixed effects, random effects and the GMM estimator proposed by Kim
and Frees (2007), such that a comparison across models can be done.
